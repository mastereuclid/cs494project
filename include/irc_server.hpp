  // I need to start a listening socket in a another thread

  // I need a thread safe data structure to hold the connections

  // I need data structure for every aspect of an irc server
  // nicks, channels... probably something more

  // a function structure so I can add a function to an event would be nice

  // I need an irc parser...
